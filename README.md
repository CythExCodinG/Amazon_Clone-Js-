🛒 Amazon Clone using HTML, CSS & JavaScript
A basic clone of the Amazon shopping website, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was created as part of my JavaScript learning journey using an implementation-based learning approach — I learn by building.

🔥 Features
🏠 Home Page – Shows product listings fetched dynamically.

➕ Add to Cart – Allows adding/removing products to/from the cart.

🛒 Cart Page – Displays selected products with quantities.

📦 Orders Page – Simulated order history view using local state.

🔄 JavaScript Fetch API – Loads products using fetch() and Promises.

💾 Local Storage – Stores cart and order data locally in the browser.

🌐 Important Note
⚠️ This project uses the Fetch API to load product data.
An active internet connection is required to run the project properly, especially if fetching from external APIs or remote files.
It won’t work offline unless all data is hosted locally and served via a local server.

🧑‍💻 Technologies Used
HTML5 – Markup

CSS3 – Styling

JavaScript (Vanilla) – Logic, DOM manipulation, fetch(), Promises, localStorage

🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Amazon_Clone-Js-.git
Open the folder and start a local server (recommended for fetch to work):

bash
Copy
Edit
# If you have Python installed
python -m http.server
Open the link (usually http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

❌ Do not open the HTML file directly (like index.html) via double-click — fetch may not work due to browser restrictions.

📚 What I Learned
JavaScript fetch() and Promises

Dynamically loading and displaying data

Basic project structuring

DOM event handling and manipulation

Using localStorage for saving cart/orders

📌 Future Goals
Add backend (Node.js or Firebase) for real-time data & user login

Responsive mobile design

Improve product filters, categories, and search

Checkout/payment simulation
